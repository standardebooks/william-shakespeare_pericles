									<span>Yet neither pleasure’s art can joy my spirits,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor yet the other’s distance comfort me.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That have their first conception by mis-dread,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And what was first but fear what might be done,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grows elder now and cares it be not done.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>’Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Since he’s so great can make his will his act,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor boots it me to say I honour him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If he suspect I may dishonour him:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And what may make him blush in being known,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He’ll stop the course by which it might be known;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With hostile forces he’ll o’erspread the land,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with the ostent of war will look so huge,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Amazement shall drive courage from the state;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Our men be vanquish’d ere they do resist,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And subjects punish’d that ne’er thought offence:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which care of them, not pity of myself,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And punish that before that he would punish.</span>
