									<span>Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Welcomed and settled to his own desire.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Unto Diana there a votaress.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now to Marina bend your mind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whom our fast-growing scene must find</span>
									<br/>
									<span>At Tarsus, and by Cleon train’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In music, letters; who hath gain’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of education all the grace,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which makes her both the heart and place</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of general wonder. But, alack,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That monster envy, oft the wrack</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of earned praise, Marina’s life</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Seeks to take off by treason’s knife.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in this kind hath our Cleon</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One daughter, and a wench full grown,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hight Philoten: and it is said</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For certain in our story, she</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Would ever with Marina be:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Be’t when she weaved the sleided silk</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With fingers long, small, white as milk;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or when she would with sharp needle wound</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The cambric, which she made more sound</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By hurting it; or when to the lute</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She sung, and made the night-bird mute,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That still records with moan; or when</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She would with rich and constant pen</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Vail to her mistress Dian; still</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This Philoten contends in skill</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With absolute Marina: so</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With the dove of Paphos might the crow</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Vie feathers white. Marina gets</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All praises, which are paid as debts,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And not as given. This so darks</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In Philoten all graceful marks,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That Cleon’s wife, with envy rare,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A present murderer does prepare</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For good Marina, that her daughter</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Might stand peerless by this slaughter.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And cursed Dionyza hath</span>
